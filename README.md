# rtl
Some scripts to help with rtl_power and all the lovely output it creates.
To use any of this you've got to have at least rtl_power of course, and gunplot. That's pretty much it. These scripts assume the existance of several directories to function properly. First order of business is to make them env variables so you can put stuff wherever you want.
